<p>This Project was created to have a complete vision of the future upcoming Inbound volume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aggregate the whole data in a unique table from an ETL.</p>
<p>As requested by the stakeholder we added <span style="text-align: inherit;">2 correlated subqueries to have a SUM aggregation for a middle granularity(line 154).</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: inherit;">The current table is used for queries and visualization</span></p>
